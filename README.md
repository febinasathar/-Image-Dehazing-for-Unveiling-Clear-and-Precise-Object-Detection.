# -Image-Dehazing-for-Unveiling-Clear-and-Precise-Object-Detection.
Image dehazing has always been a challenging problem in the field of computer vision.
Traditional Image defogging methods used manual features. With the development of artificial intelligence, the defogging method based on deep learning Approach. 
The purpose of image dehazing is to recover a clear image from one sigly noisy frame caused by haze,fog or smoke.
The dehazing algorithms have been widely considered,as a challenging instance of image restoration and enhancement.
